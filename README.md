# Run Buddy, Inc

## About
This was my first attempt at coding. The goal was to replicate some front-end design features with an already working template. There's nothing impressive here to a seasoned coder, for sure. But it marks the start of my journey. It marks something I'm extremely proud of it. It marks a new track forged in my path of life.

## Purpose
Practice CSS with an already built app for a make-believe professional fitness service. 

## Built With
* HTML
